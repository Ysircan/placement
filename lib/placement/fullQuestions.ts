All approaches aim to increase blood flow to areas of tension and to release painful knots (1) ___ muscle known as "trigger points". "Trigger points are tense areas of muscle that are almost constantly contracting," says Kippen. "The contraction causes pain, which in turn causes contraction, so you have a vicious circle. This is what deep tissue massage aims to break."

The way to do this, as I found out under Ogedengbe's elbow, is to apply pressure (2) ___ the point, stopping the blood flow, and then to release, which causes the brain to flood the affected area (3) ___ blood, encouraging the muscle to relax.

At the same time, says Kippen, you can fool the tensed muscle into relaxing (4) ___ applying pressure to a complementary one nearby. "If you cause any muscle to contract, its opposite will expand. So you try to trick the body (5) ___ relaxing the muscle that is in spasm."

For some people, this presentation may seem far-fetched, but ending poverty is both ethically necessary and actually feasible. All of us must play a role in making it happen. All human beings want, and have a way to live in dignity, to determine our own destinies, and to be respected by other, by other people. Despite the universality of three rights, our capacities to fulfill them vary enormously, and no divining line is more profound in influencing the quality of our lives than the gulf between poverty and prosperity.

The idea is that we divide the ward – the patients if you like – and the nurses into three different teams, which we call lively nursing teams. And in those teams we then have the primary nurse which is myself, associate nurses which might tend to be D grade nurses, and health care officials, and you're all in one team together. The idea is that you would hopefully work as a team in co-ordinating the care for the patients who come in under your care as in the red team. In our teams we have eight patients each. The idea would be that I would always prescribe the care or plan the care, for those patients. In reality, it doesn't always work like that and besides which the associate nurses that are in the teams have those skills anyway from their upgrading.
